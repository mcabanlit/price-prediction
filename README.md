# Bulldozer Price Prediction

We are going to implement a machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers. This data was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data).

### 1. Problem Definition
> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

### 2. Datasets
This data has been downloaded from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data) Bluebook for Bulldozers competition.
There are 2 datasets to be used:
* Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.
* Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.

### 3. Evaluation
Build a machine learning model that minimizes the root mean squared log error.

### 4. Features
The features in the dataset can be found in the data dictionary provided by Kaggle.
